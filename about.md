> "Introspect on gradients, navigate chaos, brilliance emerges, veering optimally to the summit." - ChatGPT

I'm Veeresh, a Data Scientist at [CeADAR](https://ceadar.ie/). Before that, 
I was a Masters student at University College Dublin. 
I'm still discovering my "niche" and that is why this space exists --- 
to sprinkle my thoughts on all things that pique my curiosity.
I aim to find my optimum(and hence the blog name) with each epoch as I post my 
thoughts on things I fancy currently. Maybe I'm being trained elsewhere in the 
grand scheme of things O.o??
You'll probably find posts on things related to ML/AI, math and programming.

When I'm not staring at code I go about taking pictures, learning languages and reading books.
